Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming agriculture by enabling more precise and efficient crop management. Here’s how it can be used to optimize harvests, particularly when it comes to moisture and temperature:
1.⁠ ⁠Monitoring and data collection:
Sensors and IoT (Internet of Things): Sensors placed in fields continuously measure soil moisture, air temperature, light levels, etc. This data is transmitted to an AI platform.
Drones and satellite imagery: Camera-equipped drones and satellites provide high-resolution images of crops. AI analyzes these images to detect signs of water stress, diseases, plant growth, etc.
Connected weather stations: These stations provide real-time local weather data, essential for anticipating irrigation needs and frost risks.
2.⁠ ⁠Analysis and decision-making:
Predictive models: AI uses the collected data to create predictive models. These models can predict crop water needs, disease risks, optimal harvest dates, etc.
Alerts and recommendations: Based on the analysis, AI sends alerts and recommendations to farmers. For example, it can recommend irrigating a specific plot, applying a phytosanitary treatment, or delaying harvest.
Irrigation optimization: AI can automatically control irrigation systems based on the actual needs of crops, saving water and improving yields.
Greenhouse management: In greenhouses, AI can precisely control temperature, humidity, and lighting to create optimal growing conditions.
3.⁠ ⁠Automation and robotics:
Harvesting robots: Robots equipped with sensors and vision systems can harvest fruits and vegetables autonomously, selecting only ripe produce.
Spraying drones: Drones can spray pesticides in a targeted manner, reducing the use of chemicals and limiting the environmental impact.
Benefits of AI for agriculture:
Increased yields
Reduced costs (water, fertilizers, pesticides)
Improved crop quality
Optimized use of resources
Reduced environmental impact
In summary, AI enables more precise, sustainable and profitable agriculture.
